# Final
Final Project yay

This Final Project includes:
-HTML
-CSS
-JS
-Images
-Files to reference at a later time as I plan on continuing this into a Wordpress site for my Freelance MUA work

Things I'm Proud Of
-Coming out of this class, I feel much more confident troubleshooting and debugging code, in particular HTML/CSS
-While I'm less confident in debugging JS, I feel like I HAVE a better understanding of scripts I'm reading and troubleshooting. This will help me communicate better with my engineering team
-I learned firsthand how willing other developers (friends, coworkers, and the TAs) were to actually help and resolve the issues to not only making things function but to look good. 

Things I Want To Work On
-I tried to figure out the responsive toggle/nav but just lost time for that. I'd like to complete that for myself following this course
-Still wish I felt more confident writing JS but that will come in time. Watching so many videos and reading so many articles, sifting through codepens, etc., for the carousel and toggle...I learned it really isn't easy and it REALLY is an art since it's truly its own language. I definitely have a new respect for JS and coding altogether
